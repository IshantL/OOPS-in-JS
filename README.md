# OOPS-in-JS

## Objects
1. Creating Objects:
- We are using object literal for that
```
const circle = {
    radius:1,
    location:{
        x:1,
        y:1
    },
    draw:function(){
        console.log('draw');
    }
}
circle.draw();
```
2. Factories and Constructors
- Suppose we want to create another Circle for that we need to duplicate the circle
3. Primitive and Reference Types
4. Working with properties
5. Private Properties
6. Getters/ Setters
